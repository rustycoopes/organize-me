"""Live progress for a processing run — the read side of the SSE page (Slice 4.2, #53).

The #52 pipeline runs in-process and writes a ``processing_steps`` row per step as it advances
(and flips the ``processing_runs`` status at the end). This module turns those rows into the
stream of updates the browser's HTMX SSE extension consumes:

- :func:`build_step_views` maps the (possibly partial) set of step rows onto the canonical 7
  steps, defaulting a not-yet-started step to ``pending`` — a pure function, unit-tested.
- :func:`render_step_fragment` / :func:`render_run_status_fragment` render the exact HTML the page
  first paints *and* the SSE stream later swaps in, so both come from one template (no drift).
- :func:`stream_run_progress` polls the run's rows on a short interval and yields an SSE event only
  when a step's status (or the run's status) actually changes, closing the stream with a ``done``
  event once the run reaches a terminal state (``success``/``failed``). No Redis pub/sub — there is
  no Redis (see #52's in-process decision); Postgres rows are the source of truth.
