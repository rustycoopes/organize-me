"""The 7-step processing pipeline (Slice 4.1, #52).

Turns one uploaded/detected file into extracted ``events`` rows. Runs **in-process** as an
asyncio task (no Celery/Redis - see #52's resolved decisions); state lives entirely in Postgres
via the ``processing_runs`` / ``processing_steps`` / ``events`` rows this writes as it goes, so the
SSE progress page (#53) can watch a run advance by polling those rows.

``run_pipeline`` is deliberately pure and fully injected - it takes the DB session and its
collaborators (storage, Gemini, notifier) as arguments rather than resolving them from globals - so
the integration test drives the whole thing with a ``FakeStorageProvider`` + ``FakeGeminiClient``
and asserts events land in the DB. The upload endpoint (app.api.v1.upload) wires the real
collaborators and runs this in a background task with its own session.

The 7 steps: (1) File Received, (2) Extract, (3) Filter by Date, (4) Call Gemini, (5) Parse LLM
Response, (6) Deduplicate & Save, (7) Notify. Per the Slice 4 spec the Gemini step is fatal on
error: any failure marks the run ``failed``, moves the file to ``failed/``, records the error in the
step log, and still fires a (failure) notification. A run that produces zero new events (everything
was a duplicate) is a *success*: the file moves to ``processed/`` and a "0 new events" notice fires.
