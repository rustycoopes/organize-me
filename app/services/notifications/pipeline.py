"""The processing-run notification boundary (Slice 4.1, #52).

Step 7 of the pipeline notifies the user that their upload finished (success, zero-new-events, or
failure). Real SMS (Twilio) + email (Resend) delivery is Slice 7; this slice implements only the
*seam* so the pipeline is complete and testable now:

- ``NotificationSender`` — the Protocol the pipeline depends on.
- ``LoggingNotificationSender`` — the production stub for this slice: logs the payload (no send).
- ``FakeNotificationSender`` — records payloads so tests can assert what would be sent.
- ``get_pipeline_notifier`` — factory, overridable via FastAPI ``dependency_overrides`` (mirrors
  ``app.services.notifications.email.get_email_sender`` / ``app.services.llm.gemini``).

Slice 7 swaps ``LoggingNotificationSender`` for a real sender behind the same Protocol without
touching the pipeline.
