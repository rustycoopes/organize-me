"""Google Calendar + Google Tasks link builders for the events dashboard (Slice 5.1, #54).

Both builders return a URL the browser opens in a new tab to pre-fill a "quick add" form on
Google's own site - OrganizeMe never talks to the Calendar/Tasks APIs directly, so no extra OAuth
scope or credential is needed for this feature.

Google Calendar's ``render?action=TEMPLATE`` URL is a long-standing, widely used convention for
pre-filling a new event (title/dates/details) via a plain link - it's what an "Add to Google
Calendar" button on almost any event site uses.

Google Tasks has **no equivalent officially documented URL scheme** - Google has never published a
way to pre-fill a new task via a link. ``build_google_tasks_url`` below is a best-effort
``title``/``due`` query-string convention; whether Google's frontend actually honours it needs
manual verification against a real account (tracked as a human-setup follow-up, mirroring the
Slice 4.1 Google Drive manual-QA caveat). Even if Google ignores the params, the link still opens
Google Tasks - it just won't be pre-filled.
