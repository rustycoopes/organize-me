"""Encryption helpers for storing third-party credentials at rest.

Storage-provider credentials (Google Drive OAuth tokens, S3 keys - see the `storage_configs`
table) must never be persisted in plaintext. `CredentialCipher` wraps Fernet (authenticated
symmetric encryption from `cryptography`) to encrypt on write and decrypt on read.

The cipher takes its key explicitly rather than reaching into global settings, so it's trivially
unit-testable with a throwaway generated key. Application code obtains the configured instance
via `get_credential_cipher()`, which reads `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from settings.
