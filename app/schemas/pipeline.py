"""Pydantic schema for the LLM's extracted-events payload (Slice 4.1, #52).

Step 5 of the pipeline (Parse LLM Response) validates Gemini's raw JSON text against
``ExtractedEvent`` before the deduplicate-and-save step persists it. Keeping the shape here
(rather than trusting the raw dict) means a malformed LLM response fails the run with a clear
validation error instead of surfacing later as a database or attribute error.

Mirrors the fields in ``examples/example.lmmoutput.txt`` and the ``events`` table columns
(app.models.event.Event); ``resolved_date_earliest`` is derived later (not from the LLM).
