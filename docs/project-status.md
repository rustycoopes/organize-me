## Current Phase

**Slice 1 in progress.** All prerequisites provisioned (issues #1–#9, closed). Slice 1 broken into 8 TDD-sized issues (#10–#17). Issue #10 (project scaffold + CI/CD) implemented on branch `feature/slice-1-scaffold-cicd`, not yet merged. Issue #11 (DB foundation — Supabase connection + `users` table) implemented on branch `feature/slice-1-db-foundation`, not yet merged. Next up: #12.

| 2026-07-01 | Issue #11 (DB foundation — Supabase connection + `users` table) implemented — SQLAlchemy 2.0 async engine/session, Alembic async migrations, pydantic-settings config, transaction-rollback pytest fixture against real Supabase QA DB — on branch `feature/slice-1-db-foundation` |

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Slice 1, in order:**
   - #10 Project scaffold + CI/CD pipeline — ✅ implemented, pending merge
   - #11 DB foundation — Supabase connection + `users` table — ✅ implemented, pending merge
   - #12 Email/password auth — register, login, logout
   - #13 Google OAuth login
   - #14 Forgot / reset password
   - #15 Profile — view/edit, dark mode, account deletion
   - #16 Landing page
   - #17 Sidebar shell + placeholder pages
2. **Slice 2** — Google Drive storage integration
3. **Slice 3** — LLM Prompt page

## Open Decisions

- None — all design questions resolved in `docs/implementation-plan.md`

## Known Constraints

- Gemini is the LLM provider (fixed for v1); fail immediately on LLM error (no retry)
- One cloud storage provider active per user at a time; Google Drive built first
- Pre-filled URL approach for Google Calendar / Tasks (no OAuth write)
- Open self-registration (no invite flow)
- Desktop-first UI (mobile responsiveness not required for v1)
- DaisyUI component library on top of Tailwind CSS
- Upstash Redis used for both local dev and production (no local Docker for Redis or DB)
- Celery worker co-located in same Cloud Run container as FastAPI app (supervisord)
- Cloud Scheduler polls every 15 minutes (not 5)
