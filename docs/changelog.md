## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Post-merge prod deploy hotfixes** (direct to `main`, after PR #19): Alembic `%`-interpolation
  crash, Supabase IPv6 → pooler URL, and asyncpg `statement_cache_size=0` under PgBouncer
  transaction mode. `main` green; prod `/health` live. → [archive](changelog-archive.md#post-merge-prod-deploy-hotfixes-direct-to-main-after-pr-19-merged)

### Added
- **Issue #10** — project scaffold + CI/CD (branch `feature/slice-1-scaffold-cicd`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-10--project-scaffold--cicd-pipeline-branch-feature-slice-1-scaffold-cicd)
- **Issue #11** — DB foundation: Supabase connection + `users` table (branch `feature/slice-1-db-foundation`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-11--db-foundation-supabase-connection--users-table-branch-feature-slice-1-db-foundation)
- **Issue #12** — email/password auth: register, login, logout (branch `feature/slice-1-auth-register-login`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-12--emailpassword-auth-register-login-logout-branch-feature-slice-1-auth-register-login)
- **Issue #13** — Google OAuth login (branch `feature/slice-1-google-oauth`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-13--google-oauth-login-branch-feature-slice-1-google-oauth)
- **Issue #14** — forgot/reset password (branch `feature/slice-1-forgot-reset-password`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-14--forgotreset-password-branch-feature-slice-1-forgot-reset-password-picked-up-ahead-of-13-per-direct-request)
- **Issue #15** — profile view/edit, dark mode, account deletion (branch `feature/slice-1-profile`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-15--profile-viewedit-dark-mode-account-deletion-branch-feature-slice-1-profile)
- **Issue #16** — public landing page (branch `feature/slice-1-landing-page`). → [archive](changelog-archive.md#issue-16--public-landing-page-branch-feature-slice-1-landing-page)
- **Docs restructure** — split `implementation-plan.md`'s 9 slice specs into self-contained
  per-slice files under `docs/slices/`; `implementation-plan.md` is now a thin index + shared
  reference (stack, full schema, endpoint map, utilities, testing). Reduces per-issue context read
  during implementation.
- **GitHub issues #10–#17** — Slice 1 (Project Scaffold + Auth + CI/CD) broken into 8 TDD-sized,
  independently-gradable vertical slices and published to the OrganizeMe project: scaffold +
  CI/CD (#10), DB foundation (#11), email/password auth (#12), Google OAuth (#13),
  forgot/reset password (#14), profile + dark mode + account deletion (#15), landing page (#16),
  sidebar shell (#17). See `docs/slices/slice-1.md` for the source scope.
- **GitHub issue #23** — Slice 1.8: automated Playwright E2E UX tests, added at the user's request
  to validate Slice 1's overall delivery. Targets the deployed QA Cloud Run instance via a new
  `e2e-qa` CI job (runs after `deploy-qa`, becomes a required check). Google OAuth is out of scope
  for E2E (unreliable headlessly) and stays covered by #13's backend tests. Forgot/reset-password
  is tested via a debug-only `GET /api/v1/internal/e2e/last-reset-token` endpoint (gated by
  `E2E_TEST_MODE`, wired to QA env only, 404s when unset). Blocked by #15/#16/#17.
- **`docs/implementation-plan.md`** — full implementation design spec: confirmed stack, complete
  database schema (5 tables), API endpoint map (21 endpoints), 9 vertical implementation slices,
  key utilities, testing approach, prerequisites. Produced from a structured Q&A session.

### Changed
- `docs/project-status.md` — updated phase, milestones, open decisions, and next steps to
  reflect completion of implementation planning
