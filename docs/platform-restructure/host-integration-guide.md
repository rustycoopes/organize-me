# Host Integration Guide — What Other Components Need To Set Up

**If you're standing up a brand-new hosted app right now, start with
[`how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md`](how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md) instead** — it's the condensed,
generic, forward-looking playbook (`<new-app>`-style steps, with `event-creator` as a worked
example) distilled from everything below. This doc is the **slice-by-slice historical log**: it
answers, per Platform Restructure slice, what infra was provisioned, what routing was wired up,
what secrets were introduced, and what interface/design contract each slice established — read it
for the *why* behind a rule and the gotchas a future integrator would otherwise rediscover the hard
way. Some of the earliest slices (R0, R1) were one-time platform setup, not part of onboarding a
new app — flagged inline where that applies.

It is a living document — **update it in the same PR that lands each new Platform Restructure
slice** (`docs/platform-restructure/WBS/slice-R*.md`), whether or not that slice touches another
repo directly. Each slice gets its own `## Slice R<n> — <name>` section below, added in order.

For the full architecture rationale, see
[`platform-restructure-design.md`](platform-restructure-design.md) (design) and
[`platform-restructure-prd.md`](platform-restructure-prd.md) (product intent). For the
credential/secret journey in detail, see [`secrets-and-accounts.md`](secrets-and-accounts.md) —
this doc summarizes the actionable subset; that one is the full reference.

## Manual steps a human must do outside the repo

No amount of code or CI wiring does these — an operator has to perform them by hand, usually once
per environment per app. Slice sections below tag the steps that correspond to one of these with
**→ manual step**.

1. **Create GCP Secret Manager secrets** (`gcloud secrets create ...`) for anything a new app's
   deploy step references via `--set-secrets` — e.g. a new app-specific credential. Shared secrets
   (`jwt-secret-{qa,prod}`, `encryption-key-{qa,prod}`) already exist and just need the new app's
   deploy service account granted `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`, if it isn't already
   (today, every service runs as the same shared deploy SA, so this is usually a no-op — see
   `secrets-and-accounts.md`).
2. **Set GitHub Actions secrets** (`GCP_SA_KEY`, `SUPABASE_QA_URL`/`SUPABASE_PROD_URL`, and any
   app-specific ones) in the new app's own repo — never inherited from the Host's repo.
3. **Register OAuth redirect URIs** in the Google Cloud Console (and Dropbox's app console, if
   applicable) for any new domain/service that will receive an OAuth callback — Google/Dropbox
   match redirect URIs as an exact string; a routing or domain change that isn't re-registered here
   breaks the connect flow silently until someone tries it (see the R7 gotcha below).
4. **Provision the Cloud Run service, Serverless NEG, and backend service** for a new app via
   `infra/gcp_lb/provision.sh` (QA) / `provision-prod.sh` (prod) — idempotent `gcloud` scripts, not
   part of CI, run once per environment before the app's registry entry means anything.
5. **Import the regenerated Load Balancer URL map** (`gcloud compute url-maps import ...`) after
   running `infra/gcp_lb/generate_url_map.py` — the generator only prints YAML; nothing applies it
   automatically.
6. **Confirm DNS is editable** for any brand-new subdomain (Cloud DNS zone / registrar nameservers)
   before Load Balancer provisioning — a one-time platform-level step (R0), not per-app.

## Quick-start checklist for a brand-new hosted app

See [`how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md`](how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md)'s Quick-start checklist — that's the
single, maintained copy of this list now (this doc used to carry its own near-duplicate; folded in
to avoid the two drifting). One item from the old copy is worth calling out here since it's easy to
miss and isn't spelled out in the other doc's checklist itself: every page route that renders the
shared chrome must pass the Host's `dark_mode` preference (read via the `HostUser` cross-schema
mapping — see R7 below) into `chrome_base.html`'s `theme_attr()` call, not just the routes you
remember to check first — a page that forgets always renders light-only regardless of the user's
Host Profile setting (see the R7 gotcha and issue #207).

Everything below traces exactly which slice introduced each requirement in that checklist, and
what's still pending.

---

## Slice R0 — DNS control for `organizeme.russcoopersoftware.com`

> **One-time platform setup — already done, not part of onboarding a new app.** A new app reuses
> the existing `organizeme(.qa).russcoopersoftware.com` origin; it never needs its own DNS zone or
> subdomain. Kept here for historical context only.

**Type:** Manual ops, no code. **→ manual step** (see the checklist above) — this whole slice was
one.

- **Infra:** New Cloud DNS public zone `russcoopersoftware-com` in GCP project
  `gen-lang-client-0791944342`; registrar (Squarespace) nameservers repointed to it.
- **Routing:** None yet — this only proves DNS is editable. The actual A/AAAA cutover to the Load
  Balancer IP happens in R5 (QA) and R11/R12 (prod).
- **Secrets:** None.
- **Interface impact on other components:** None directly, but it's the blocking prerequisite for
  R5's managed SSL cert, so no hosted app gets a stable shared-origin URL until this lands.

## Slice R1 — Database schema separation

> **One-time platform setup — already done, not part of onboarding a new app.** R1 established the
> `host`/`event_creator` split that already exists; a new app doesn't redo this, it just follows
> the interface contract below (own schema, own Alembic history, narrow `REFERENCES`-only grant if
> it needs a Host FK).

- **Infra:** Two Postgres schemas, `host` and `event_creator`, in the existing shared Supabase
  instance. Two `NOLOGIN` roles, `host_app` and `event_creator_app`, least-privilege per schema.
- **Routing:** None.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract for other components:**
  - Every table your app owns lives in **your own schema**, never `host` or another app's schema.
  - If you need a real FK back to `host.users.id`, you get a narrow `REFERENCES`-only grant on that
    one column — never `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE` on `host.*`.
  - Your Alembic history must set `version_table_schema` to your own schema name so it never
    collides with the Host's or another app's migration history, even though everyone connects to
    the same physical database.
  - Migrating existing tables into a new schema is metadata-only (`ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA`) —
    no data rewritten.

## Slice R2 — Decouple Event Creator data from the Host `users` model

- **Infra:** New `event_creator.user_settings` table (notification prefs, onboarding flags),
  FK-cascaded to `host.users.id`.
- **Routing:** None.
- **Secrets:** None.
- **Interface contract:** Any per-user preference/state that isn't strictly account identity
  (email, password, OAuth) belongs in **your own schema**, not on the Host's `users` table — create
  it lazily (get-or-create) rather than eagerly at registration, since the Host has no idea your
  app exists at registration time.

## Slice R3 — Shared chrome/theme package + app-registry

- **Infra:** New `packages/chrome/` package, `organizeme-chrome`, published by the Host's CI as a
  versioned GitHub Release wheel/sdist on `chrome-v*` tag push (git-tag dependency pin, not a
  private PyPI registry).
- **Routing:** N/A directly, but this package now bundles the app-registry data that R5 turns into
  routing rules.
- **Secrets:** None.
- **Interface contract for other components — this is the core integration surface:**
  - Depend on `organizeme-chrome` as a **pinned** version — bumping it is a deliberate, explicit
    action in your repo, never automatic. A Host-side chrome edit never silently changes what your
    app renders.
  - It gives you: Jinja macros/templates for sidebar/header/Settings tab-bar, the Tailwind/DaisyUI
    theme, the app-registry data, and a standalone JWT-verify helper (PyJWT-based — signature +
    expiry + audience only, **no** fastapi-users import, **no** network call).
  - You add your app's nav items and Settings tabs to the app-registry (authored in the Host repo);
    this one file drives both what renders in the sidebar and (from R5 onward) what the Load
    Balancer routes to you.
  - Extend `chrome_base.html` / `chrome_authenticated_base.html` from the package for every page —
    don't hand-roll chrome.

## Slice R4 — Domain-scoped SSO cookie + Secret Manager

- **Infra:** `JWT_SECRET` moved off plaintext env vars into GCP Secret Manager
  (`jwt-secret-qa`/`jwt-secret-prod`), read via `--set-secrets` by the Cloud Run runtime service
  account (`170051512639-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`, granted
  `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on it).
- **Routing:** N/A — cookie domain scoping is deferred until R5/R11 land (still unset on
  `*.run.app` hosts as of R6).
- **Secrets:** Your `gcloud run deploy` step needs
  `--set-secrets=JWT_SECRET=jwt-secret-{qa,prod}:latest`. This must be the **exact same secret**,
  byte-identical, as the Host's — that identity is the entire SSO trust mechanism, not a
  coincidence. **→ manual step** if your app introduces a genuinely new secret; granting your
  deploy SA `secretmanager.secretAccessor` on the *existing* `jwt-secret-*`/`encryption-key-*`
  secrets is usually a no-op today since every service shares one deploy SA (see the checklist
  above).
- **Interface contract:** Your app verifies the JWT's signature + expiry only. It never signs a
  JWT, never handles a password, never talks to fastapi-users.

## Slice R5 — GCP HTTPS Load Balancer + path routing + managed SSL

- **Infra:** External HTTPS Load Balancer, two global static IPs (v4+v6), Cloud DNS A/AAAA records
  in the R0 zone, Google-managed SSL cert, one Serverless NEG per Cloud Run service, backend
  services, URL map, target-HTTPS-proxy, global forwarding rules. Provisioned via
  `infra/gcp_lb/provision.sh` (idempotent `gcloud` script, not Terraform) — a manual operator run,
  not part of CI. **→ manual step** — see the checklist above.
- **Routing:** `infra/gcp_lb/generate_url_map.py` turns the app-registry (R3) into URL-map path
  rules automatically: the Host's fixed auth routes always win a collision; two non-host apps can't
  claim the same path (build-time guard). Applying the generated map is itself a **→ manual step**
  (`gcloud compute url-maps import`) — the generator only prints YAML.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract:** Once your app-registry entry lists your nav paths, you get routed to
  automatically the next time the URL map is regenerated — you don't hand-edit the Load Balancer
  yourself. Your Cloud Run service needs its own Serverless NEG/backend service added at this
  layer (done for Event Creator in R6, below) — provisioning that NEG/backend for a brand-new app
  is a **→ manual step** too (same `provision.sh`/`provision-prod.sh` scripts).

## Slice R6 — Event Creator scaffold + SSO-trust tracer bullet

- **Infra:** First independent hosted-app repo (`event-creator`), its own `event-creator-qa` /
  `event-creator-prod` Cloud Run services, own CI/CD mirroring the Host's `.github/workflows/`
  shape (build → test → deploy, no Host build/redeploy involved).
- **Routing:** `event-creator-qa` attached to the R5 URL map's second NEG/backend so
  `organizeme.qa.russcoopersoftware.com/dashboard` routes there.
- **Secrets:** Reads `JWT_SECRET` from Secret Manager (same value as Host, R4). Does **not** need
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` yet (no stored credentials of its own).
- **Interface contract exercised end-to-end for the first time:**
  - `GET /dashboard` → verify JWT (signature + expiry via the R3 helper) → extract `user_id` →
    render shared chrome + placeholder body. No login/session/registration code in this repo at
    all.
  - Owns the `event_creator` schema (moved to it in R1) with its **own** Alembic history from here
    on — the Host no longer touches those tables' migrations.
  - Unauthenticated request to `/dashboard` redirects to the Host's login — proves the negative
    case, not just the happy path.
  - **Gotcha hit during this slice:** the Host's own `pyproject.toml` had a stale
    `organizeme-chrome` pin that silently kept the live URL map on the pre-R3-split registry — the
    Host repo must bump its own chrome-package pin whenever the package's app-registry changes, the
    same as any other consumer.

## Slice R7 — Parity 1: Storage + Settings tabs

- **Infra:** No new Cloud Run/DNS resources — same `event-creator-{qa,prod}` services from R6.
  New GCP Secret Manager secrets: `google-oauth-client-secret-{qa,prod}`,
  `dropbox-oauth-client-secret-{qa,prod}` (client *ids* are non-confidential and travel as plain
  Cloud Run env vars instead, alongside `DATABASE_URL`). `encryption-key-{qa,prod}` already existed
  from R6 and needed no new setup.
- **Routing:** None new — Storage/Notifications/Preferences are tab *content* Event Creator
  contributes to the Host-rendered Settings shell via the app-registry (R3), not new top-level
  routes the Load Balancer needs to know about.
- **Secrets:** `--set-secrets=ENCRYPTION_KEY=encryption-key-{qa,prod}:latest` (Fernet key,
  encrypts stored OAuth tokens/S3 keys at rest) alongside R4's `JWT_SECRET`. OAuth client *secrets*
  (Google/Dropbox) also travel via `--set-secrets`, matching the reasoning that confidential values
  never sit in a plaintext env-vars file readable via `gcloud run services describe`.
- **Interface contract:**
  - Event Creator owns `event_creator.storage_configs` (one row per user, encrypted
    Drive/Dropbox/S3 credentials) and drives the R2 `user_settings` table's notification toggles.
  - A hosted app that stores third-party credentials encrypts them at rest with the shared
    `CredentialCipher`/`ENCRYPTION_KEY` pattern (`app/core/security.py`) — never plaintext.
  - The Host still renders the Settings *shell* (tab-bar chrome, per R3); a hosted app supplies
    only tab *content* and declares its tabs via the app-registry — no hosted-app chrome code.
  - OAuth callback redirect URIs for a hosted app's own connect flow are *additional* authorized
    redirect URIs added to the Host's existing Google/Dropbox OAuth app consoles (client id/secret
    are shared with the Host, not a separate registered app per hosted service). **→ manual step**
    — see the checklist above.
  - **Gotcha found in issue #200 (fixed 2026-07-15):** build that redirect_uri from a fixed,
    per-environment setting (e.g. `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI`), never from the incoming request's
    Host header (`request.base_url`). Google matches redirect URIs as an exact string, and a
    dynamically-derived value silently tracks whatever domain/service happens to receive the
    request — it only works by coincidence until the next load-balancer or service-boundary
    change (exactly what broke Drive-connect in QA after Storage moved behind the LB in this
    slice). Whenever a hosted app's own domain/routing changes, re-register the exact new
    redirect URI on the OAuth client in Google Cloud Console — this is a manual, outside-repo step
    the code cannot perform or detect (**→ manual step**).
  - **Gotcha hit during this slice:** `HostUser` (the SELECT-ONLY cross-schema mapping a hosted app
    uses to read Host fields like `email`/`phone_number`) must be registered on the **same**
    `Base`/`MetaData` as the hosted app's own models, not a separate `DeclarativeBase` — otherwise
    any string-based `ForeignKey("host.users.id")` on your own tables fails to configure at all
    (`NoReferencedTableError`). Safety from Alembic ever trying to *manage* that table instead comes
    from `migrations/env.py`'s `include_object` filter (excluding the `host` schema outright), not
    from keeping it off the shared metadata.
  - **Theme sync (fixed in issue #207, not caught until R9/R11 pages had already shipped):**
    `HostUser` also carries `dark_mode` — the Host Profile's light/dark preference — for the exact
    same reason it carries `email`/`phone_number`: it's a Host-owned field a hosted app needs to
    render correctly but never owns or writes. Every page route must call a `get_dark_mode(db,
    user_id)` helper (a thin wrapper over `get_host_user()` that defaults to `False` when the row
    is missing — see `app/services/host_user.py` in `event-creator`) and pass the result as
    `dark_mode` in its template context, the same context key `chrome_base.html`'s `theme_attr()`
    reads. R8/R9's initial page ports (`dashboard.py`, `processing.py`, `prompt.py`, `logs.py`,
    `upload.py`) each hardcoded `"dark_mode": False` instead, deferring the lookup as "out of
    scope" — the Settings > Notifications fragment (this slice) had already wired the identical
    `get_host_user()` call for `email`/`phone_number`, so the fix was reusing an existing, already-
    proven pattern, not building a new one. **Lesson for future hosted-app pages:** any new page
    route that renders the shared chrome needs this wiring from day one; it's easy to ship a page
    that "looks right" in light mode and only surfaces the gap when a user with `dark_mode=true`
    visits it.

## Slice R8 — Parity 2: Upload + Pipeline + Processing + Logs

- **Infra:** Real Celery worker process, standing up what the monolith's `app/worker.py` only ever
  stubbed (`autostart=false`, no `REDIS_URL` deployed, no task defined). Event Creator's container
  now runs supervisord with two programs — `[program:web]` and `[program:worker]`, both
  `autostart=true` — the worker consuming the same Upstash Redis instance as its broker/backend.
  New GCP Secret Manager secrets: `redis-url-{qa,prod}` (a `rediss://` connection string, treated
  as confidential the same way OAuth client secrets are), granted `secretmanager.secretAccessor` on
  the Cloud Run runtime service account. Cloud Run deploys for this service now also set
  `--timeout=3600`, matching the Host's own long-request-timeout convention — the SSE progress
  stream needs it.
- **Routing:** None new — `/api/v1/upload`, `/processing`, `/logs` etc. are additional paths on the
  existing `event-creator-{qa,prod}` services, already routed by R5/R6.
- **Secrets:** `--set-secrets=REDIS_URL=redis-url-{qa,prod}:latest` alongside the existing
  `JWT_SECRET`/`ENCRYPTION_KEY`/OAuth-client-secret entries. `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`,
  and `TWILIO_*` are read as plain (non-Secret-Manager) env vars for now, matching how the monolith
  itself configured them — a future hardening pass could move these into Secret Manager too, same
  as R4 did for `JWT_SECRET`.
- **Interface contract:**
  - A hosted app that needs background/async work runs its **own** Celery worker inside its own
    Cloud Run container (via supervisord, one process per `[program:*]` block) — it does not share
    a worker or a task queue with the Host or any other hosted app. Each app's tasks are named and
    routed independently (`Celery("event_creator", ...)` here), even though the Redis instance
    happens to be reused.
  - A Celery task must only ever receive JSON-serialisable arguments (ids/strings) — never a live
    object like a DB session, an open HTTP client, or an in-memory storage provider, since none of
    those survive the hop to a separate worker process. Reconstruct collaborators fresh inside the
    task from those ids (a persisted config row, `get_settings()`, etc.).
  - An in-memory/ephemeral fallback storage provider (no persistent, cross-process backing store)
    can't be handed to a worker process by reference — its bytes must travel in the task payload
    itself (base64, capped at the same size limit the upload endpoint already enforces) if a hosted
    app wants a resilient fallback that survives the process boundary.
  - SSE/long-lived streaming endpoints need Cloud Run's request timeout raised past the default
    (`--timeout=3600` here) — the default is far too short for a connection meant to stay open for
    the life of a background job.

## Slice R9 — Parity 3: Dashboard + Events + Prompt

- **Infra:** None new — the Dashboard/Events/Prompt surfaces are additional routes on the existing
  `event-creator-{qa,prod}` Cloud Run services, already provisioned by R5/R6.
- **Routing:** None new. `/dashboard` was already routed to `event-creator` since the R6 tracer
  bullet — this slice replaces its placeholder body with the real events table, so the change goes
  live the moment it's deployed. `/prompt` is a genuinely new route added to `event-creator`, but
  the app-registry (`packages/chrome/src/organizeme_chrome/registry.py`) still lists it under the
  Host's own `AppNavItem` list, same as `/upload`/`/processing`/`/logs` since R8 — full-page-route
  cutover for these paths is deliberately deferred to the **R11 QA Cutover** slice, not done
  incrementally per parity slice (unlike R7's Settings-tab fragments, which don't need an LB path
  change since the Host keeps rendering the `/settings` shell and only fetches tab content via
  `hx-get`). Until R11 lands, the Host's own `/prompt` keeps serving live traffic; Event Creator's
  new `/prompt` route exists and is tested but isn't reachable through the shared Load Balancer
  yet.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract:**
  - The `events`, `llm_prompts`, and `user_settings` tables (adopted into `event_creator`'s schema
    since R1/R2) now have their full read/write surface in Event Creator:
    `GET`/`DELETE`/`PATCH /api/v1/events{,/{id}}`, `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/llm-prompt` +
    `POST /api/v1/llm-prompt/reset`. A hosted app reading/writing rows in another app's schema
    (e.g. a future app wanting event data) must go through these endpoints, not direct DB access.
  - The Getting Started onboarding checklist reads `event_creator.user_settings`'s three boolean
    flags (`onboarding_storage_done`, `onboarding_notifications_done`,
    `onboarding_first_upload_done`, all already wired by R2/R7/R8's storage-connect/notification/
    upload write-paths) — no new flag or table was needed for this slice.
  - Re-enabled `e2e/tests/import-pending-files.spec.ts`'s Dashboard-page case (issue #185), skipped
    since R7 exposed that `/dashboard` had routed to Event Creator's placeholder since R6. A hosted
    app that reuses a Host-authored partial (here, the "Import pending files" button) should keep
    its markup (element ids in particular) identical so shared e2e coverage keeps working
    unmodified.
  - The post-login redirect (`GOOGLE_OAUTH_SUCCESS_REDIRECT`/`LOGIN_SUCCESS_REDIRECT` in
    `app/api/v1/auth.py`) still targets `/profile`, not `/dashboard` — the monolith never made this
    switch despite the Dashboard existing since R6. Left as-is here as well: repointing the
    post-login landing page is a user-visible auth-flow change with its own risk, better done as
    its own reviewed follow-up than folded into this slice — see the GitHub issue filed alongside
    this slice's PR.

## Slice R10 — Host↔Event Creator boundary E2E test suite

> Backfilled here after being missed when R10 shipped — see R11's section below for how this gap
> was caught (during R11's own "compare against acceptance criteria" pass).

- **Infra:** None new.
- **Routing:** None new — the boundary suite drives the existing shared QA Load Balancer domain.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract:**
  - New `e2e/tests/host-event-creator-boundary.spec.ts` (organize-me) proves the seams the R6-R9
    split created still hold: logout at the Host clears the cookie Event Creator relies on for
    auth, and Event Creator's JWT trust (`app.core.auth.current_user_id_optional` in the
    event-creator repo) rejects a garbage cookie value and a tampered-signature token. Login-once
    SSO and no-cookie rejection were already covered by `sidebar.spec.ts`; a Host Profile field
    reaching an Event-Creator-owned dependency was already covered by `notifications.spec.ts`.
  - `event-creator`'s own CI gained a new `e2e-boundary-qa` job (checks out organize-me's `main`,
    runs only the boundary spec against live QA after `deploy-qa`) — a hosted app that wants its
    own CI to catch a boundary regression, not just the Host's, can follow this same pattern:
    checkout the Host repo at a fixed ref, run only the specific spec(s) relevant to that app.
  - Account-deletion cascade to an independent microservice's own schema isn't observable over
    HTTP (a stateless JWT-trust boundary never queries the Host's `users` table), so it's asserted
    directly against the schema instead: one DB-level cascade test per `event_creator` table with
    a direct `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK to `host.users` (`test_user_settings_model.py`,
    `test_storage_config_model.py`, `test_llm_prompt_model.py`, `test_event_model.py` in the
    event-creator repo).

## Slice R11 — QA cutover + full verification (P0 gate)

- **Infra:** None new — reuses the `event-creator-{qa,prod}` Cloud Run services and the shared LB
  provisioned by R5/R6.
- **Routing:** The actual cutover. `packages/chrome/src/organizeme_chrome/registry.py`'s
  `event-creator` `AppEntry` gains `/upload`, `/processing`, `/logs`, `/prompt` (moved off the
  Host's own entry), plus the API/fragment `api_prefixes` behind them (`/api/v1/events`,
  `/api/v1/llm-prompt`, `/api/v1/upload`, `/api/v1/import-pending-files`,
  `/api/v1/processing-runs`, the bare `/processing-runs` page-detail prefix, and
  `/api/html/processing-runs` for the log-partial fragment). The QA Load Balancer's URL map was
  regenerated from the updated registry (`uv run python -m infra.gcp_lb.generate_url_map`) and
  re-imported live (`gcloud compute url-maps import organizeme-qa-url-map ...` — the same
  idempotent step `infra/gcp_lb/provision.sh` already performs, re-run standalone rather than the
  whole script since every other resource already existed). The Host's own copies of these
  pages/endpoints are left in place, now simply unreachable through the LB — removing them is
  R13's job, not this one's.
  - **A hosted app that wants its nav paths cut over from the Host must publish this timing
    explicitly**: R7-R9 built full parity for these four pages but deliberately deferred their LB
    routing until this dedicated verification slice, rather than flipping traffic incrementally
    per parity slice (unlike Settings-tab fragments, which never needed an LB change at all — see
    R7's section above). Follow that same pattern for any future hosted-app page migration: build
    and test parity first, cut routing over as its own reviewed, verified step.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract:**
  - `organizeme-chrome` bumped to `chrome-v0.4.0` (registry-only change; both this repo's own pin
    and `event-creator`'s were bumped and redeployed before the live URL-map import, so both
    services render sidebar/Settings-tab chrome from the same registry snapshot the moment
    routing flips).
  - A previously-undetected gap surfaced by this slice's "compare against acceptance criteria"
    pass: Event Creator never got its own `/upload` **page** (only the `POST /api/v1/upload` API,
    ported in R8) — R8's own tests never exercised the page because they only needed the API.
    Backfilled here (`app/pages/upload.py` + `app/templates/pages/upload.html` in the
    event-creator repo, near-verbatim port of the Host's own `app/pages/upload.py`/
    `templates/upload.html`) before cutting `/upload`'s routing over — a lesson for any future
    slice that assumes "the API exists" implies "the page exists": verify both independently
    before routing a nav path to a service.
  - New e2e specs closing the PRD-story-13–52 verification gap that had no prior browser-level
    coverage: `dashboard.spec.ts`, `logs.spec.ts`, `upload.spec.ts` (organize-me `e2e/tests/`).
    All three are routing-agnostic (they assert observable page behaviour, not which backend
    served the request), so they were written and could pass *before* the cutover too — proving
    Host and Event Creator's parity implementations are behaviourally equivalent was exactly the
    point.
  - Event-Creator's own `organizeme-chrome` pin had silently drifted to `chrome-v0.2.0` (missing
    R7's `api_prefixes` field and Settings-tab ownership move) with zero observable effect, purely
    by coincidence: nav *paths* never changed between v0.2.0 and v0.3.0, and the Host's own
    `/settings` shell reads Event Creator's tab list via an explicit `get_app("event-creator")`
    call (`app/pages/settings.py`), never through Event Creator's own (stale) `register_chrome`
    global. Fixed alongside the R11 pin bump. **Lesson for future slices:** a hosted app's own
    chrome pin can go stale without any CI or runtime signal if nothing it renders happens to
    depend on the changed fields — don't assume "no visible bug" means "the pin is current."

### R11 redesign — Celery/Redis replaced with Cloud Tasks (post-cutover fix)

R11's live cutover surfaced a blocker documented in full in
`docs/adr/0001-event-creator-worker-cpu-throttling.md`: the R8 Celery worker crash-loops under
Cloud Run's request-based CPU throttling (a separate always-on process has no HTTP request of its
own to justify CPU allocation). Resolved by replacing Celery/Redis with Cloud Tasks push-based
dispatch — this is a redesign within R11, not a new numbered slice.

- **Infra:** New Cloud Tasks queues, `event-creator-pipeline-{qa,prod}`
  (`max-concurrent-dispatches=1`, `max-attempts=3`), provisioned via `event-creator`'s
  `infra/cloud_tasks/provision.{sh,ps1}` (mirrors `infra/gcp_lb/provision.sh`'s idempotent,
  manual-operator-run pattern). The Celery worker process is gone entirely — `event-creator`'s
  `supervisord`/two-program container from R8 reverted to a single plain `uvicorn` process
  (`app.worker`, `supervisord.conf` removed). QA's `--no-cpu-throttling` experiment (the ADR's
  short-term validation) is reverted; both QA and prod stay on request-based billing throughout.
- **Routing:** New internal endpoint `POST /internal/pipeline/run` on the existing
  `event-creator-{qa,prod}` services — not part of the app-registry/Load-Balancer routing (it's
  never reached via the shared LB; Cloud Tasks pushes directly to the service's own
  `https://*.run.app` URL, bypassing the LB).
- **Secrets:** `redis-url-{qa,prod}` no longer read (Redis/Upstash dependency removed). New
  plaintext (non-Secret-Manager) env vars: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `CLOUD_TASKS_LOCATION`,
  `CLOUD_TASKS_QUEUE`, `PIPELINE_INVOKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `PIPELINE_ENDPOINT_URL` (the last one
  self-referential — captured from `gcloud run services describe` in a follow-up deploy step,
  since a service can't know its own URL before its first deploy). See
  `secrets-and-accounts.md`'s Cloud Tasks entry for the IAM grants.
- **Interface contract:**
  - A hosted app that needs background/async work on Cloud Run **without** moving to
    instance-based billing should push each unit of work back to itself as a genuine HTTP request
    (Cloud Tasks push target with OIDC verification), not a separate always-on worker process —
    Cloud Run's CPU throttling model only allocates CPU to a request it's actively handling, so
    detached background work (a Celery worker *or* a plain `asyncio.create_task()`) needs
    `--no-cpu-throttling` either way. This was a real design-review correction: the initial
    instinct (revert to the monolith's in-process asyncio) turned out to need the same
    CPU-always-allocated flag the monolith itself required (see the ADR's Resolution section) —
    it doesn't actually avoid the cost problem.
  - The push endpoint must self-verify the Cloud-Tasks-presented OIDC token in code (`aud` +
    `email` claims against expected values) rather than relying on Cloud Run's own IAM gate, since
    the service as a whole stays `--allow-unauthenticated` for its normal user-facing routes.
  - The push handler must be idempotent (check the target resource isn't already in a terminal
    state before processing) — Cloud Tasks retries are a real possibility (lost response, queue
    retry policy), and a task queue offers no exactly-once guarantee.
  - "Sequential, not concurrent" batch processing (the same requirement R8's Celery `chain` met)
    is **not** guaranteed by a queue's `max-concurrent-dispatches=1` setting alone — that only
    bounds concurrency, not dispatch *order* (Cloud Tasks documents order as best-effort by
    schedule time, and a retry on an earlier item can let a later item's task become eligible
    first). A code-review pass caught this before it shipped: strict ordering is met by explicit
    chaining instead — only the batch's first item is enqueued directly; each payload carries the
    rest of the batch, and the push endpoint enqueues the next item itself once the current one
    finishes (including on a retried/already-terminal redelivery, so the chain can resume even if
    an earlier attempt died between finishing its item and advancing the chain).

## Slice R12 — Production cutover (done)

- **Infra:** Production External HTTPS Load Balancer fronting `organizeme.russcoopersoftware.com`
  provisioned via `infra/gcp_lb/provision-prod.{sh,ps1}` — same shape as R5's QA setup, every
  resource suffixed `-prod` instead of `-qa` (GCP global resource names can't be shared across
  environments): two static IPs, Cloud DNS A/AAAA records, a Google-managed cert
  (`organizeme-prod-cert`), Serverless NEGs against `organizeme-prod`/`event-creator-prod`, three
  backend services (`host-backend-prod`, `organizeme-backend-prod`, `event-creator-backend-prod`),
  a URL map, an HTTPS proxy, and forwarding rules. `infra/gcp_lb/generate_url_map.py` gained an
  optional environment argument (`... generate_url_map prod`) to rename every backend consistently.
- **Already-satisfied prerequisites, confirmed via read-only `gcloud` checks rather than re-done:**
  the prod Cloud Tasks queue (`event-creator-pipeline-prod`) already existed and is `RUNNING`; both
  prod services are already on request-based billing (`run.googleapis.com/cpu-throttling: true`, no
  `min-instances`); `E2E_TEST_MODE` is unset on both. The `host`/`event_creator` prod schema
  separation is presumed already applied too, since `deploy.yml` runs the Alembic migration on
  every prod deploy and prod has deployed successfully many times since R1 landed — a failing
  migration would have failed those deploys.
- **Cutover completed:** the managed cert went `ACTIVE` (faster than the ~24h estimate); routing
  verified directly against the LB IP with the prod Host header (`/login` → Host backend `200`,
  `/dashboard` → Event Creator backend `302`, the expected unauthenticated redirect). The user
  registered the new redirect URIs on the Google OAuth client in Cloud Console and confirmed
  `google-oauth-client-secret-prod` matches the real client secret (the same class of bug found in
  issue #203 for QA). `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`/`GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI` flipped to the LB
  domain in `organize-me`'s `deploy.yml`; `event-creator`'s prod `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI` was
  already pointed there (set proactively during #200, since event-creator-prod wasn't yet receiving
  real traffic), so no change was needed there.
- **Post-cutover smoke tests surfaced two live bugs, both fixed (neither an R12 regression — both
  were latent, first exercised by this cutover's real-upload test):**
  - **Stale Google Drive OAuth token in prod.** `event-creator-prod` failed every upload/import
    with a Fernet `InvalidSignature` decrypting the stored `oauth_access_token` — it had been
    encrypted before `ENCRYPTION_KEY` moved to GCP Secret Manager, under a different key value than
    what's there now. Fixed by reconnecting Google Drive in prod Settings (re-encrypts under the
    current key); no code change. Any other prod user who connected Drive before that Secret Manager
    migration and hasn't uploaded since would hit the same error — flagged as issue #206 for a
    deliberate audit decision.
  - **Missing `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `event-creator`.** R11 moved the Gemini-calling pipeline here, but
    the key was only ever wired into `organize-me`'s `ci.yml`/`deploy.yml` — invisible to CI since
    tests mock the Gemini client. Fixed in `event-creator` PR #14
    (`fix/wire-gemini-api-key`): added the GitHub secret and wired it into both QA and prod Cloud
    Run env.
- Real login (existing data confirmed intact) and a real upload (pipeline ran to completion) both
  verified working end-to-end in prod after both fixes.

## Slice R13 — Host Cleanup + "How to Add a Hosted App" Playbook

- **Infra:** None new. The Host's Celery worker process definition (`[program:worker]` in
  `supervisord.conf`, always `autostart=false` and never wired to real `REDIS_URL`/tasks since
  the R11-redesign moved that architecture to Cloud Tasks in `event-creator` instead) was removed
  — the Host's container now runs a single `uvicorn` process.
- **Routing:** None. The Host's own app-registry entry (`packages/chrome/src/organizeme_chrome/
  registry.py`'s `"organizeme"` `AppEntry`) already only listed `/settings` and `/profile` — the
  Dashboard/Upload/Processing/Logs/Prompt nav items had already moved to the `event-creator`
  entry back in R11, so no registry/URL-map change was needed for this slice.
- **Secrets:** None new.
- **Interface contract / what changed:**
  - Removed the Host's now-dead event-extraction code entirely: the page modules, API routers,
    `app/services/{pipeline,llm,storage}/` (whole dirs), the pipeline-only parts of
    `app/services/notifications/` (kept `email.py` — still used for the Host's own
    password-reset emails), `app/core/{prompts,date_parser,calendar_url,message_filter,
    onboarding}.py`, `app/worker.py`, their SQLAlchemy models (`Event`, `LLMPrompt`,
    `ProcessingRun`, `ProcessingStep`, `StorageConfig`, `UserSettings`), their Pydantic schemas,
    and their Jinja templates. `app/api/v1/users.py`'s `UserRead`/`UserUpdate` also dropped
    `notification_email`/`notification_sms` — those fields read/wrote
    `event_creator.user_settings` (moved there in R2, and R7 already migrated the Settings UI for
    them to event-creator), so exposing them on the Host's own `/api/v1/users` was leftover
    surface with no remaining owner-side purpose once the model was removed.
  - `app/pages/app_shell.py`'s placeholder-page logic no longer needs to special-case
    Dashboard/Upload/Processing/Logs/Prompt paths (`PAGES_WITH_OWN_ROUTER` shrank to
    `{"/profile", "/settings"}`) — those paths were never in the Host's own registry nav to begin
    with, so this was pure code cleanup, not a behavior change.
  - Wrote [`how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md`](how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md), the condensed forward-looking
    playbook for app #3+, validated against `event-creator`'s real registry entry, `jwt_verify`
    usage, and `organizeme-chrome` pin.
  - **Test ownership, established as a repeatable rule (not just this slice's cleanup):** unit and
    e2e tests live with the code they exercise, in the owning app's own repo. Concretely for this
    slice: every Host-side unit test for the removed modules was deleted from `organize-me/tests/`
    only after confirming verified-equivalent coverage already existed in `event-creator/tests/`
    (not assumed from filename match — `notifications.spec.ts` was found missing from the original
    removal list during review and ported to `event-creator`, PR #17, before its Host copy was
    deleted). The event-extraction Playwright specs (`upload.spec.ts`, `processing.spec.ts`,
    `storage.spec.ts`, `prompt.spec.ts`, `logs.spec.ts`, `import-pending-files.spec.ts`,
    `dashboard.spec.ts`, `notifications.spec.ts`) moved into `event-creator`'s own Playwright suite,
    which didn't exist before this slice — event-creator gained its own e2e config as part of the
    move, not just the spec files.
  - **Exception: `e2e/tests/host-event-creator-boundary.spec.ts` stays in the Host, permanently.**
    It asserts the *seam* between the two apps (JWT cookie flow, logout propagation, tampered-token
    rejection), not either app's internals — a future third app gets the same treatment: any test
    that exercises whether the Host's auth/cookie contract still holds from another app's point of
    view belongs in the Host as a boundary spec; everything else belongs in that app's own repo.
    See [`how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md`](how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md)'s "Test ownership" section for
    the full rule.
  - **Interface contract for future slices:** removing a hosted app's leftover code from the Host
    is purely additive-safe cleanup as long as (a) the app-registry's nav for that app already
    points entirely at the other service (true here since R11), and (b) any Host-owned code that
    happens to import the app's models/schemas (found here: `app/api/v1/users.py` reading
    `UserSettings` for notification prefs) gets explicitly untangled first, not just deleted
    alongside — grep for cross-imports before assuming a module is exclusively
    event-extraction's.
  - Deferred items still open after this slice (unchanged by it, listed here for continuity):
    `COOKIE_DOMAIN`/full cross-domain SSO cookie scoping (still not needed — both services share
    a hostname via the LB); per-schema DB connection identity (`host_app`/`event_creator_app`
    roles unused, both apps still connect as the shared admin `DATABASE_URL`); `DATABASE_URL` as a
    GitHub Actions secret rather than Secret Manager; the post-login redirect target (`/profile`,
    not `/dashboard` — issue #189, still unresolved, out of scope for this slice since it's a
    user-visible auth-flow change); the hardcoded QA LB domain duplicated across both repos' CI
    configs (issue #191).

## How to keep this doc current

When you finish implementing a slice (whether in `organize-me` or a hosted-app repo), add a new
`## Slice R<n> — <name>` section here, in slice order, covering:

- **Infra** — what GCP/Cloud Run/DNS/DB resources were created or changed.
- **Routing** — what changed in the Load Balancer URL map or how a request gets to a service.
- **Secrets** — what a hosted app now needs to read, from where, via what mechanism.
- **Interface contract** — what a hosted app must now do (or must never do) to integrate
  correctly; call out any gotcha a future integrator would otherwise rediscover the hard way.
- If a step is something an operator must do by hand outside the repo (a `gcloud`/Console action,
  not something CI runs), add it to (or tag it back to) the "Manual steps" checklist near the top.
- If the slice was one-time platform setup rather than a repeatable per-app step, say so explicitly
  (see R0/R1 above for the pattern) instead of leaving it ambiguous.

Keep each section short and actionable. This doc is deliberately the *full* slice-by-slice history
(that's also the WBS files' job, in more detail) — but its purpose here is narrower: only the parts
of each slice that another component/integrator needs to know.
For the condensed, forward-looking version of the same information (no slice history, just "what
do I do today"), see [`how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md`](how-to-add-a-hosted-app.md) and update that
doc too if a new slice changes the generic pattern (e.g. a new required registry field, a new
class of secret every app needs).
